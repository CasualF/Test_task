For deployment I used AWS's EC2 service
To make the process easier I used docker, otherwise
I would have to manually configure nginx and gunicorn.

I did this:
1. Prepared docker-compose and nginx configurations
2. Pushed changes to github repo
3. Created an instance in EC2 and connected to it
4. sudo apt update -> sudo apt install docker docker-compose
5. Cloned my repo and cd {name of repository}
6. Built and started my project with "sudo docker-compose up --build"
